There are three things to note. First, we create our buffer once and reuse it on every
call to r.Read. This allows us to use a single memory allocation to read from a poten‐
tially large data source. If the Read method were written to return a []byte, it would
require a new allocation on every single call. Each allocation would end up on the
heap, which would make quite a lot of work for the garbage collector.
